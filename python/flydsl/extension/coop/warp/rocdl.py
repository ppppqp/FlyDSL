"""ROCDL overrides for the warp-scope collectives.

``warp_permute`` uses ``ds_bpermute`` across ROCm targets. The reduction and
scan overrides below are gfx9-only: ``row_bcast`` and ``wave_shr`` are CDNA DPP
controls that RDNA dropped in favour of ``row_share`` / ``permlanex16``. That
requires a different sequence rather than a different constant, and has less
to gain because LLVM's own rewrite already reaches pure DPP there.
