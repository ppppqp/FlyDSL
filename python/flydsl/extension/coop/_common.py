"""Helpers shared by every cooperative algorithm, at any scope.

Anything here is target-neutral and never dispatched: it is plain glue that
warp- and block-scope algorithms both need. Algorithm logic belongs in the
scope subpackages, not here.

Every algorithm passes *op* straight through to these three, so the shape of a
custom op is not baked into any signature above this file.
