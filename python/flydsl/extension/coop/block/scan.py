        of those, and a downsweep to push the prefixes back out. ``block_threads`` slots of shared
        memory and three barriers, but the cross-lane work collapses to one warp.
    ``RAKING_MEMOIZE``

        instead of re-reading them during the downsweep: fewer shared memory reads at the cost of
        ``segment_length`` live registers in the raking warp.

    """Block-wide prefix scan.

    Specialize it, allocate its shared storage, then ask for the form you want::

        block_scan = fx.coop.BlockScan[fx.Float32, 256]
        storage = fx.SharedAllocator().allocate(block_scan.SharedStorage).peek()
        running = block_scan.inclusive(value, fx.ReductionOp.ADD, storage=storage)

    The parameters are ``[dtype, block_size, algorithm]``, exactly as for
    :class:`~flydsl.extension.coop.BlockReduce` — *block_size* is either the x extent or the full
    ``(x, y, z)`` — except that ``algorithm`` defaults to ``BlockScanAlgorithm.WARP_SCANS``.

    ``value`` is either one scalar per thread or a ``Vector`` of several per-thread items. A
    ``Vector`` scans as if its items sat consecutively in the block's sequence — thread ``t`` owns
    items ``t * n .. t * n + n - 1`` — and the result is a ``Vector`` of the same length.

    Passing ``init=`` folds a value in ahead of the whole block, so the first thread's exclusive
    result is ``init`` rather than :func:`~flydsl.extension.coop._common.identity`.

    :meth:`inclusive_with_aggregate` and :meth:`exclusive_with_aggregate` return ``(result,
    block_aggregate)`` instead. The aggregate is the fold of every thread's input, valid in all of
    them. It reuses what the scan already staged in shared memory, so it adds ``num_warps - 1``
    folds and no traffic at all — and nothing whatsoever when a caller ignores it. It is what lets a
    kernel carry a running total across tiles.

    Every thread of the block has to reach the call, and reach it together, exactly as for
    :class:`~flydsl.extension.coop.BlockReduce`: it synchronizes the block and reads across lanes,
    and the specialization's *block_size* has to be the size the kernel is actually launched with.

    Threads are ordered by their linear id, and *op* has to be associative but not commutative:
    every fold on the way, the warp-scope scan included, keeps its operands in that order. That is
    the opposite of :class:`~flydsl.extension.coop.BlockReduce`, whose implemented policies all
    need a commutative *op* today — see :class:`BlockReduceAlgorithm` for why.

    Reusing *storage* for a second collective call needs a :func:`~flydsl.expr.gpu.barrier` in
    between, since this one leaves the block unsynchronized after its last read.
