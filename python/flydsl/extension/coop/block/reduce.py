    """How a block folds its per-thread partials into one value.

    Every policy implemented so far needs a commutative *op*, whatever its name suggests. The block
    layer itself folds in order — a raking lane walks its segment by ascending index, and the
    per-warp totals are combined lowest warp first — but the warp-scope reduction underneath does
    not, so the requirement belongs to the collective rather than to any one policy.

    So no member below is currently distinguished by accepting a non-commutative *op*, and none can
    be while every :class:`~flydsl.expr.typing.ReductionOp` on offer is commutative.

    ``RAKING``
        Stage every thread's partial in shared memory, then let a single warp walk ("rake")
        equal-length segments of it. ``block_threads`` slots of shared memory, but the cross-lane
        work collapses to one warp. Named for the variant that honours operand order, which this
        one does not yet.
    ``RAKING_COMMUTATIVE_ONLY``
        *Planned, not implemented.* Raking that spends the freedom to reorder: the first warp keeps
        its partial in registers rather than staging it, and the rake strides by the warp width
        instead of walking a contiguous segment, which is bank-conflict-free where a contiguous
        walk is not. That access pattern is what it would add — the relaxed ordering it is named
        for is already in force above.
    ``WARP_REDUCTIONS``
        Reduce inside each warp with shuffles, then fold the per-warp aggregates through shared
        memory. Only ``num_warps`` slots of shared memory and one barrier.
    ``WARP_REDUCTIONS_NONDETERMINISTIC``
        *Planned, not implemented.* Warp reductions whose combining order may vary between runs,
        which makes floating-point results irreproducible.

    The parameters are ``[dtype, block_size, algorithm]``. *block_size* is either the x extent on
    its own or the full ``(x, y, z)``, and must be a power of two in total.

    Where the kernel declares its own block size — the usual case, either through
    ``known_block_size`` or inferred from a static launch — passing
    :func:`~flydsl.expr.gpu.known_block_size` straight through is the way to keep the two in step
    without repeating the dimensions::

        block_reduce = fx.coop.BlockReduce[fx.Float32, fx.known_block_size()]

    ``value`` is either one scalar per thread or a ``Vector`` of several per-thread items. Calling
    the specialization directly returns a result valid in every thread of the block.
    :meth:`reduce_to_leader` instead leaves it valid only in linear thread 0, avoiding replicated
    cross-warp work when that one thread is the sole consumer.

    Every thread of the block has to reach this call, and reach it together. It synchronizes the
    block and reads across lanes, so a call made under a condition that is not uniform block-wide
    hangs on the barrier or folds in lanes with no defined value.

    *op* must be commutative under every algorithm implemented so far, and associative under all of
    them; :class:`BlockReduceAlgorithm` says where that comes from and why no policy is currently
    free of it. Nothing depends on the distinction while every
    :class:`~flydsl.expr.typing.ReductionOp` is commutative.

    Reusing *storage* for a second collective call needs a :func:`~flydsl.expr.gpu.barrier` in
