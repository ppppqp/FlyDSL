"""The portable implementations, under the public names, never displaced.

``fx.coop.warp_reduce`` resolves through ``extension/_dispatch.py``: on the ROCm
backend it is the DPP sequence in ``warp/rocdl.py``, not the shuffle butterfly in
``warp/reduce.py``. ``fx.coop.universal.warp_reduce`` is that butterfly, and stays
it on every target.

The names, the signatures and the results are the same either way — a target
override is only ever a faster route to the same answer — so ``universal`` is not
a second API to learn. It is the same one with dispatch turned off, which two
callers want:

- **A kernel that measured it.** An override is faster on the shapes it was
  tuned for, not on every shape; a caller that found the portable form better on
  its own can say so, rather than being stuck with whatever the target picked.
- **A test.** Running both and comparing them against each other is what catches
  an override that is wrong in a way a host reference would not show, and it is
  the only way to reach the portable code at all once an override exists for the
  target being tested.
