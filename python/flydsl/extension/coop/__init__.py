"""Cooperative algorithms over the threads of one kernel launch.

    ├── universal.py   the portable forms, dispatch turned off
    ├── warp/

    │   ├── reduce.py      warp_reduce
    │   ├── scan.py        warp_inclusive_scan, warp_exclusive_scan, warp_scan,
    │   │                      warp_scan_with_aggregate
    │   └── rocdl.py       ROCm overrides for the above

That surface is flat — ``fx.coop.<name>`` — so callers never spell the scope
out twice (``fx.coop.warp_reduce``, not ``fx.coop.warp.warp_reduce``).

Those names are dispatched: on a target with an override, ``fx.coop.warp_reduce``
is the target's. ``fx.coop.universal`` is the same surface with dispatch turned
off — see :mod:`flydsl.extension.coop.universal`.
